# ChatterBot - from the DevChatter Community

**ChatterBot** is a user-focused, highly moddable Twitch chat bot. It's designed to be extended by developer and non-developer streamers.
- For the developers, it's designed to be extendable and have their existing bot's commands integrate with ChatterBot.
- For the non-developers, it will be easy to include custom scripts and modules built for Chatter bot as well as ones built for other chat bots.
